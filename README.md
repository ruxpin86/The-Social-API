# Install

1. Clone this SSH Key link: [GitHub](https://github.com/ruxpin86/The-Social-API) on your Terminal (Mac) or gitBash(Windows).

2. This app uses [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongooose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose). You can simply install these by running "npm i" on your Integrated Terminal in VS-Code

3. Step by step guide video on how to use this app and test routes after cloning, is attached below in [Preview](#preview). I used Insomnia specifically, but PostMan would work as well do demonstrate that it is functional.

# Learned

For this challenge we were tasked with gaining a better understanding of MongoDB/Mongoose and how implement these tools to reflect common usage in a Social Networking apps API. CRUD operations for users and user-to-user interactions are on display, setting up the linkages for them to interact on a one to one basis. I would like to eventually implement what I learned in this challenge to the work we did in project 2 to better flesh out its functionality.
